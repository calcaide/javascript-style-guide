## Introduction

The following document is a set of rules or conventions that I take from many others style guides.

This guide does not pretend to substitute the excellent other guides that are out there, is just my personal cheat sheet that I use to work and I decided to share it.

I use [ECMAScript 6](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript) specification and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) as a compiler.

Also, I have another project [js-test-bench](https://github.com/calcaide/js-test-bench) that could be used as a playground to test the conventions or rules that are here.
